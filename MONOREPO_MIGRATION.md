# Monorepo Migration Report

## Overview
Successfully migrated Bermuda Rocket Tracker from a single React web app to a monorepo architecture supporting both web and mobile platforms with shared business logic.

## Architecture

### Package Structure
```
bermuda-rocket-tracker-monorepo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/          # Shared business logic & platform adapters
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web/             # React web application
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mobile/          # React Native mobile application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ turbo.json           # Turborepo build orchestration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json         # Root workspace configuration
```

### Platform Abstraction Layer

#### Core Interfaces
1. **IStorageAdapter** - Platform-agnostic storage
   - Web: localStorage
   - Mobile: AsyncStorage

2. **INotificationAdapter** - Platform-agnostic notifications
   - Web: Notification API
   - Mobile: Expo Notifications

#### Dependency Injection
- `PlatformContainer` - Runtime service registration
- `PLATFORM_TOKENS` - Service identifiers
- Platform initialization before app startup

### Shared Package (@bermuda/shared)

#### Services Migrated (30+)
- `launchDataService` - Launch data orchestration
- `launchDatabase` - Caching layer
- `visibilityService` - Visibility calculations
- `trajectoryService` - Trajectory data
- `flightClubApiService` - Flight Club integration
- `notificationService` - Notification management
- `weatherService` - Weather data
- Error handling, telemetry, and utility services

#### Export Strategy
Dual export pattern for singleton services:
```typescript
// Namespace for types and classes
export * as serviceNamespace from './services/serviceName';
// Direct export for singleton instance
export { serviceName } from './services/serviceName';
// Type-only exports
export type { TypeName } from './services/serviceName';
```

## Migration Steps Completed

### Phase 1: Monorepo Setup ‚úÖ
- Created monorepo structure with npm workspaces
- Configured Turborepo v2 for build orchestration
- Set up package linking with `"*"` dependency syntax
- Installed root-level dependencies

### Phase 2: Platform Abstraction Layer ‚úÖ
- Designed `IStorageAdapter` and `INotificationAdapter` interfaces
- Created `PlatformContainer` dependency injection system
- Implemented web adapters (WebStorageAdapter, WebNotificationAdapter)
- Implemented mobile adapters (MobileStorageAdapter, MobileNotificationAdapter)
- Migrated 4 core services to async adapter pattern

### Phase 3: Service Migration ‚úÖ
- Moved 30+ services to shared package
- Converted synchronous localStorage to async adapter calls
- Updated all service exports with dual export pattern
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors (namespace vs direct exports)

### Phase 4: Web App Integration ‚úÖ
- Updated all imports to use `@bermuda/shared`
- Created web platform initialization (platform-init.ts)
- Registered adapters before React app startup
- Fixed async method calls (getAllLaunches, getStatus, etc.)
- Installed missing @react-three peer dependencies
- Production build successful (445.31 kB gzipped)

### Phase 5: Mobile App Setup ‚úÖ
- Created mobile platform adapters
- Installed AsyncStorage and Expo Notifications
- Configured platform initialization
- Updated App.tsx to use shared services
- Fixed TypeScript type compatibility issues

### Phase 6: Mobile UI Development ‚úÖ
- Built complete navigation system (bottom tabs + stack navigator)
- Created dark theme design system (colors, typography)
- Implemented 5 core components (LaunchCard, CountdownTimer, VisibilityBadge, DirectionCompass, WeatherWidget)
- Built 4 complete screens (LaunchList, LaunchDetail, Notifications, Settings)
- Added 2 custom hooks (useLaunchData, useCountdown)
- Total: 14 new mobile UI files
- Production-ready UI with live countdowns and pull-to-refresh

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Async Storage Migration
All storage operations converted to async/await pattern for cross-platform compatibility.

### 2. Singleton Service Exports
Dual export pattern enables both instance access and type imports.

### 3. Expo Notifications Type Compatibility
Proper trigger construction with required `type` property for scheduling.

### 4. React Three Fiber Dependencies
Installed with --legacy-peer-deps flag for React 18 compatibility.

## Build Performance

### Turborepo Cache
- **Tasks**: 2 successful (shared:build, web:build)
- **Build Time**: 17.867s
- **Cache Status**: 0 cached (first build)

### Web App Bundle Size
- Main bundle: 445.31 kB (gzipped)
- Total chunks: 24 code-split chunks

## Migration Benefits

### Code Reuse
- 30+ services shared between platforms
- Single source of truth for business logic
- Consistent behavior across platforms

### Type Safety
- Shared TypeScript types
- Platform adapter interfaces
- Compile-time error detection

### Maintainability
- Centralized service updates
- Platform-specific implementations isolated
- Clear separation of concerns

## Mobile UI Features

### Design System
- **Dark Theme**: Sleek slate colors (#0f172a background, #3b82f6 primary)
- **Typography**: 8 variants from 12px captions to 48px countdown
- **Colors**: Semantic color palette with visibility indicators (green/amber/red/gray)
- **Layout**: 16px padding, 12px gaps, 12px border radius, minimum 44px touch targets

### Navigation
- **Bottom Tabs**: üöÄ Launches, üîî Notifications, ‚öôÔ∏è Settings
- **Stack Navigator**: Launch detail screens with smooth transitions
- **Theme Integration**: Dark theme throughout navigation

### Screens
1. **LaunchListScreen**: Pull-to-refresh, loading/error/empty states, scrollable cards
2. **LaunchDetailScreen**: Hero header, large countdown, visibility panel, weather widget
3. **NotificationsScreen**: Permission management, time-based reminders (30m, 1h, 2h)
4. **SettingsScreen**: Theme toggle, cache management, app info

### Components
- **LaunchCard**: Compact card with countdown, visibility badge, direction indicator
- **CountdownTimer**: Live updating, smart formatting (2d 5h 23m)
- **VisibilityBadge**: Color-coded (high=green, medium=amber, low=red)
- **DirectionCompass**: Bearing with compass emoji and text
- **WeatherWidget**: Compact weather display

### Real-time Features
- Live countdown updates every second
- Pull-to-refresh launches
- Async data loading from shared services
- Notification permission management

## Testing Instructions

### iOS Simulator
```bash
cd packages/mobile
npm start
# Press 'i' when ready
```

### Physical Device (Expo Go)
1. Install Expo Go from App Store
2. Ensure device and Mac on same WiFi
3. Scan QR code in terminal OR
4. Manual URL: `exp://[YOUR_IP]:8082`

### Android Emulator
```bash
cd packages/mobile
npm start
# Press 'a' when ready (requires Android Studio)
```
