# Phase 1: Monorepo Migration - COMPLETED

## ‚úÖ Accomplishments

### 1. Monorepo Structure Created
- Root package.json with npm workspaces configured
- Turborepo configuration (turbo.json) updated to v2.x syntax (`tasks` instead of `pipeline`)
- All three packages in place:
  - `@bermuda/shared` - Business logic and utilities
  - `@bermuda/web` - React web application
  - `@bermuda/mobile` - React Native Expo application

### 2. Shared Package Successfully Built
- **Location**: `/Users/pato/bermuda-rocket-tracker-monorepo/packages/shared`
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
- **Contents**:
  - 31 service files
  - 18 utility files
  - Type definitions
  - Platform-agnostic environment configuration
- **Build Output**: CJS, ESM, and TypeScript declaration files
- **Bundle Size**: ~300KB

### 3. Mobile App Migrated
- **Moved from**: `/Users/pato/bermuda-rocket-tracker-mobile`
- **Moved to**: `/Users/pato/bermuda-rocket-tracker-monorepo/packages/mobile`
- **Package Name**: Changed to `@bermuda/mobile`
- **Dependencies**: Added `@bermuda/shared` workspace dependency
- **Duplicate Code**: Removed `src/shared` directory (33 copied files deleted)

### 4. Web App Configuration
- **Location**: `/Users/pato/bermuda-rocket-tracker-monorepo/packages/web`
- **Package Name**: Changed to `@bermuda/web`
- **Dependencies**: Added `@bermuda/shared` workspace dependency

### 5. Dependency Management
- Root monorepo: 1,151 packages
- Shared package: 148 packages
- Successfully resolved rollup native module issue

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Web App Build Failing
**Cause**: Web app still contains duplicate services/utils/types that haven't been removed yet. The app needs to:
1. Update all imports from local paths (`../services/`, `../utils/`, `../types`) to `@bermuda/shared`
2. Remove duplicate directories after imports are updated

**Impact**: Web app build fails, but this is expected and will be fixed in Phase 2

### Browser API Dependencies
The shared package currently includes browser-specific APIs that will crash on mobile:
- `localStorage` (in launchDatabase.ts, indexedDBCache.ts)
- `IndexedDB` (in indexedDBCache.ts)
- `Notification` API (in notificationService.ts, delayNotificationService.ts)
- `window` object (in multiple services)

**Next Step**: Implement platform abstraction layer (Phase 2)

## üìã Next Steps - Phase 2: Platform Abstraction Layer

### Critical Tasks:
1. **Create Dependency Injection Container**
   - File: `packages/shared/src/platform/PlatformContainer.ts`
   - Implement service registration and resolution
   - Define tokens for all platform services

2. **Implement Storage Adapter**
   - Interface: `packages/shared/src/adapters/storage.ts`
   - Web implementation: `packages/web/src/adapters/webStorage.ts` (localStorage)
   - Mobile implementation: `packages/mobile/src/adapters/mobileStorage.ts` (AsyncStorage)
   - Update services: launchDatabase.ts, indexedDBCache.ts

3. **Implement Notification Adapter**
   - Interface: `packages/shared/src/adapters/notifications.ts`
   - Web implementation: Web Push API
   - Mobile implementation: Expo Notifications
   - Update services: notificationService.ts, delayNotificationService.ts

4. **Update Web App Imports**
   - Replace all relative imports with `@bermuda/shared` imports
   - Remove duplicate services/, utils/, types directories
   - Verify build succeeds

5. **Initialize Platform Adapters**
   - Web: Initialize in `packages/web/src/index.tsx`
   - Mobile: Initialize in `packages/mobile/App.tsx`

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Current):
- [x] Monorepo structure created
- [x] Shared package builds successfully
- [x] Mobile app moved and configured
- [x] Web app configured (but build failing as expected)
- [x] Duplicate code removed from mobile
- [ ] Duplicate code removed from web (pending Phase 2)

### Phase 2 (Next):
- [ ] Platform abstraction layer implemented
- [ ] Web app imports updated to use @bermuda/shared
- [ ] Mobile app can use shared services
- [ ] Both apps build successfully
- [ ] No runtime errors from browser APIs on mobile

## üìä Metrics

### Code Reduction:
- **Before**: 33 service files + 18 utils duplicated across 2 projects = 102 files
- **After**: 31 services + 18 utils in shared package = 49 files
- **Reduction**: 53% fewer files to maintain

### Build Times:
- Shared package: ~7 seconds
- Full monorepo build: Currently failing (expected)

### Dependencies:
- Root: 1,151 packages
- Shared: 148 packages (minimal, platform-agnostic)
- Mobile: Lightweight (Expo + React Native only)

## üîß Technical Achievements

1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All type errors resolved
2. **Platform-Agnostic Config**: Created browser-independent environment.ts
3. **Notification API Compatibility**: Removed non-standard notification properties
4. **Workspace Protocol**: Configured npm workspaces correctly
5. **Turborepo v2**: Updated configuration to latest syntax

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Ready for Phase 2

The foundation is solid. Phase 2 will focus on making the shared package truly platform-agnostic and updating the web app to consume it correctly.

**Estimated Time for Phase 2**: 4-6 hours
**Priority**: HIGH (required for web app to work)
