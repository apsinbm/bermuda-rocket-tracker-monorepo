## Next Steps

### Step 1: Finish Mobile-Specific Adaptations (2-3 days)

The following services need minor tweaks for React Native:

#### A. Create AsyncStorage Adapter
```bash
# Create: src/adapters/storage.ts
```
This will replace `localStorage` with AsyncStorage for mobile.

#### B. Adapt Notification Service
```bash
# Modify: src/shared/services/notificationService.ts
```
Replace Web Push API with Expo Notifications.

#### C. Create Mobile UI Components
```bash
# Create components in: src/components/
```
Convert web components to React Native equivalents:
- LaunchCard → Use `View`, `Text`, `Image` instead of HTML
- WeatherDisplay → Same business logic, different UI
- Countdown → Native animations

### Step 2: Build First Screen (1 day)

**Create HomeScreen.tsx:**
```typescript
import { View, Text, FlatList } from 'react-native';

// Shows:
// - Next upcoming launch countdown
// - List of future launches
// - Quick launch visibility status
```

### Step 3: Test on Real Device (1 day)

```bash
# Start Expo development server
cd /Users/pato/bermuda-rocket-tracker-mobile
npx expo start

# Then:
# 1. Install "Expo Go" app on your iPhone/Android
# 2. Scan the QR code
# 3. App loads on your phone instantly!
```

### Step 4: Add Native Features (2-3 days)

#### Push Notifications
```typescript
// Request permission
const { status } = await Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync();

// Schedule notification
await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "Launch in 30 minutes!",
    body: "Falcon 9 visible from Bermuda",
    data: { launchId: "123" }
  },
  trigger: { date: launchTime }
});
```

#### Background Updates
```typescript
// Refresh launch data in background
TaskManager.defineTask('background-fetch', async () => {
  const launches = await launchDataService.getLaunches();
  // Update notifications if needed
});
```

### Step 5: Build for Production (1-2 days)

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure build
eas build:configure

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android
```

### What's Already Working
✅ All visibility calculations
✅ All trajectory processing
✅ Weather API integration
✅ Flight Club API integration
✅ Launch Library API integration
✅ Time zone calculations
✅ Solar position calculations

### What Needs Mobile Adaptation
🔧 UI components (HTML → React Native)
🔧 Storage (localStorage → AsyncStorage)
🔧 Notifications (Web Push → Expo)
🔧 Navigation (React Router → React Navigation)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Run on iOS simulator (macOS only)
npm run ios

# Run on Android emulator
npm run android

# Run in web browser (for testing)
npm run web

# Type check
npm run tsc

# Clear cache (if issues)
npx expo start -c
```

## Testing on Real Devices

### iPhone
1. Install "Expo Go" from App Store
2. Run `npx expo start`
3. Scan QR code with Camera app
4. App opens in Expo Go

### Android
1. Install "Expo Go" from Play Store
2. Run `npx expo start`
3. Scan QR code in Expo Go app
4. App loads instantly

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need a Mac for iOS development?
**A:** For testing, no! Use Expo Go on iPhone. For App Store submission, yes (or use EAS Build cloud service).

### Q: How much code can I reuse from the web app?
**A:** About 90%! All business logic (services, utils) works identically.

### Q: Can I update both apps at once?
**A:** Yes! Update web app services, then copy to mobile. Most changes require zero modification.

### Q: How long until I can test on my phone?
**A:** Right now! Run `npx expo start` and scan the QR code.
