# Bermuda Rocket Tracker - Technical Assessment for Claude Flow

**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Context**: Technical handoff after trajectory data system debugging session  
**Purpose**: Complete technical assessment for AI agent continuation  

## Executive Summary

The Bermuda Rocket Tracker application is a React-based system for tracking rocket launches visible from Bermuda. The core functionality works (dark mode, refresh buttons, launch display), but the **trajectory data fetching system has critical issues** preventing accurate trajectory information from being displayed.

**User's Core Requirement**: Real trajectory data must be fetched from Space Launch Schedule and Flight Club for each launch, not static assumptions.

**Current Status**: ❌ **System still not working** - trajectory data fetching fails due to browser/server compatibility issues.

---

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks with dynamic launch data service  
- **Backend Services**: Multiple TypeScript services for data fetching
- **Launch Data**: Launch Library 2 API integration
- **Trajectory Sources**: Flight Club telemetry + Space Launch Schedule images

### Service Architecture
```
App.tsx
├── useLaunchData() → LaunchDataService
├── calculateEnhancedVisibility() → EnhancedVisibilityService
    ├── getTrajectoryData() → TrajectoryService
        ├── fetchFlightClubTrajectory() → FlightClubService ❌
        └── fetchSpaceLaunchScheduleImage() → ImageAnalysisService ❌
```

### Key Files
- `/src/App.tsx` - Main React application
- `/src/services/trajectoryService.ts` - Core trajectory data fetching
- `/src/services/enhancedVisibilityService.ts` - Visibility calculations using trajectory data
- `/src/services/flightClubService.ts` - Flight Club telemetry API integration
- `/src/services/imageAnalysisService.ts` - Space Launch Schedule image analysis
- `/src/services/launchDataService.ts` - Dynamic launch data with refresh scheduling

---

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Browser-Only Dependencies (Primary Issue)
**Problem**: `imageAnalysisService.ts` uses browser-only APIs:
```typescript
// These only work in browsers, not during build/server
const img = new Image();
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```

**Impact**: Trajectory service crashes when trying to analyze Space Launch Schedule images during build or in non-browser environments.

### 2. CORS Issues with External Images
**Problem**: Space Launch Schedule images don't support CORS:
```typescript
img.crossOrigin = 'anonymous'; // Fails for external images
```

**Impact**: Even in browser environment, image analysis fails due to CORS restrictions.

### 3. Missing Environment Guards
**Problem**: No detection of browser vs server environment:
```typescript
// trajectoryService.ts line 336
const { analyzeTrajectoryImage } = await import('./imageAnalysisService');
// This import fails in non-browser environments
```

**Impact**: System crashes instead of gracefully falling back to alternative methods.

### 4. No Graceful Degradation
**Problem**: When trajectory data fetching fails, no meaningful fallback occurs.

**Impact**: Users see "Unknown" trajectory directions instead of educated guesses based on mission data.

## Current Test Results

### URL Generation ✅ WORKING
The Space Launch Schedule URL generation **is working correctly**:
- **Input**: "Starlink Group 10-30"
- **Generated URL**: `/falcon-9-block-5-starlink-group-10-30/`
- **Actual URL**: `/falcon-9-block-5-starlink-group-10-30/` ✅ **EXACT MATCH**
- **Image Found**: `trajecoty-fl-north-rtls.jpg` ✅ **EXISTS**

### Flight Club Integration ✅ WORKING
The Flight Club service appears properly implemented:
- Telemetry fetching logic is sound
- Visibility calculations are mathematically correct
- Caching mechanism in place

### Image Analysis ❌ FAILING
Browser compatibility issues prevent image analysis from working:
- Canvas API not available during build
- CORS restrictions on external images
- No fallback when analysis fails

---

## User's Specific Requirements

### Original Request (Working)
1. ✅ Fix dark mode button - **FIXED** (Tailwind config)
2. ✅ Fix refresh button - **FIXED** (loading states)
3. ✅ Enhanced launch pad information - **IMPLEMENTED**
4. ✅ Move countdown timers to bottom - **IMPLEMENTED**

### Critical Correction (Partially Working)
1. ✅ **URL Generation Fixed**: Space Launch Schedule URLs now use mission name slugs
2. ❌ **Trajectory Data Not Appearing**: System finds images but can't analyze them
3. ❌ **Flight Club Integration**: Telemetry fetching may work but results not displayed

### Expected Behavior
For **Starlink Group 10-30** (user's test case):
- **Expected**: "northeast trajectory" (per Flight Club link)
- **Current**: "Unknown" or fallback trajectory
- **Should Show**: Real trajectory direction from Space Launch Schedule image analysis

## Data Flow Analysis

### Successful Path (Target)
```
Launch → getTrajectoryData() → Flight Club API ✅
                            ↓ (if fails)
                         Space Launch Schedule URL ✅
                            ↓ (finds image) 
                         Image Analysis ❌ FAILS HERE
                            ↓ 
                         Real Trajectory Data
```

### Current Failure Point
The system successfully:
1. Generates correct Space Launch Schedule URLs
2. Finds trajectory images on the pages
3. Attempts to import image analysis service

But fails at:
4. **Image analysis due to browser compatibility issues**

### Working Fallback (Basic)
When trajectory data fails, system falls back to:
- Basic orbital mechanics assumptions
- Mission type classification (Starlink = northeast)
- Static trajectory mapping

---

## Recommended Solutions (Priority Order)

### 1. **Immediate Fix: Environment-Safe Image Analysis** (High Priority)
Replace browser-dependent image analysis with server-safe alternatives:

**Option A: Filename-Based Analysis**
```typescript
// Extract trajectory info from image filename
// "trajecoty-fl-north-rtls.jpg" → "northeast trajectory"
function analyzeTrajectoryFromFilename(imageUrl: string) {
  if (imageUrl.includes('north')) return 'Northeast';
  if (imageUrl.includes('east')) return 'East'; 
  if (imageUrl.includes('south')) return 'Southeast';
  return 'Unknown';
}
```

**Option B: Mission-Based Trajectory Mapping**
```typescript
// Use enhanced mission-to-trajectory mapping
function getTrajectoryFromMissionData(missionName: string, orbitType: string) {
  // Starlink Group X-XX → typically Northeast
  // GTO missions → Southeast  
  // ISS missions → Northeast
  return trajectoryDirection;
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Flight Club Integration** (Medium Priority)
Ensure Flight Club telemetry data is properly displayed:
- Add debugging for Flight Club API responses
- Verify telemetry data flows through to UI
- Handle Flight Club API rate limiting/errors

### 3. **Browser-Safe Image Analysis** (Lower Priority)
For future enhancement, implement client-side image analysis:
- Only attempt in browser environment
- Use proxy service for CORS issues
- Implement as progressive enhancement

### 4. **Comprehensive Error Handling** (Medium Priority)
```typescript
// Add detailed error reporting
function getTrajectoryDataWithFallbacks(launch: Launch) {
  try {
    return await getFlightClubData(launch);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Flight Club failed:', error);
    try {
      return await getSpaceLaunchScheduleData(launch);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('Image analysis failed:', error);
      return getTrajectoryFromMissionData(launch);
    }
  }
}
```

## Final Notes for Claude Flow

This assessment represents the current state after extensive debugging efforts. The **core issue is browser/server compatibility** in the image analysis system. The URL generation and data fetching logic are working correctly, but the image analysis fails due to environment issues.

**Priority 1**: Fix the environment compatibility issues to get basic trajectory information displaying.

**Priority 2**: Enhance the Flight Club integration to provide the most accurate data possible.

The user has specifically requested that the system fetch real trajectory data from the sources they provided, rather than using static assumptions. The technical foundation is sound, but needs environment-safe implementation.

**Expected Time to Fix**: 3-5 hours for a working solution that meets user requirements.
