## FAILURE SCENARIOS & RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### 1. DEPLOYMENT FAILURE

**Symptoms:**
- Build pipeline fails
- Application won't start
- Critical functionality broken
- Health checks failing

**Immediate Response (2-5 minutes):**

```bash
# Step 1: Verify the issue
curl -I https://bermuda-rocket-tracker.vercel.app
# Check response code and headers

# Step 2: Access Vercel Dashboard
# Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
# Navigate to: bermuda-rocket-tracker project → Deployments
```

**Rollback Procedure - Option A (Vercel Dashboard):**

1. **Login to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Navigate to project deployments
   - Identify last successful deployment (green checkmark)
   - Click "..." menu → "Promote to Production"
   - Confirm rollback

2. **Verify Rollback Success**
   ```bash
   # Wait 30 seconds for propagation
   sleep 30
   
   # Test main endpoint
   curl -f https://bermuda-rocket-tracker.vercel.app
   
   # Check health endpoints
   curl https://bermuda-rocket-tracker.vercel.app/static/js/
   ```

**Rollback Procedure - Option B (Git Revert):**

```bash
# Step 1: Identify problematic commit
git log --oneline -10

# Step 2: Revert the problematic commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Step 3: Push to trigger re-deployment
git push origin main

# Step 4: Monitor deployment
# Check GitHub Actions tab for pipeline progress
```

### 2. API SERVICE OUTAGE

**External Dependencies:**
- Launch Library API (ll.thespacedevs.com)
- OpenWeatherMap API (api.openweathermap.org)

**Symptoms:**
- No launch data loading
- Weather information unavailable
- API timeout errors in console

**Recovery Procedure:**

```bash
# Step 1: Identify which API is down
curl -I https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/upcoming/
curl -I https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather

# Step 2: Check API service status pages
# Launch Library: Check their GitHub or documentation
# OpenWeatherMap: Check status.openweathermap.org
```

**Application Response:**
- App has built-in fallback mechanisms
- Cached data used when APIs unavailable
- Graceful degradation with user notifications
- No rollback required - wait for service restoration

### 3. COMPLETE SITE OUTAGE

**Symptoms:**
- Site unreachable (DNS failure)
- 5xx server errors
- CDN issues

**Immediate Response:**

```bash
# Step 1: Check site accessibility
curl -I https://bermuda-rocket-tracker.vercel.app
nslookup bermuda-rocket-tracker.vercel.app

# Step 2: Check Vercel system status
# Visit: https://vercel-status.com

# Step 3: Emergency rollback via CLI
npx vercel --prod --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN
# Follow prompts to deploy previous version
```

**If Vercel Platform Issue:**
- Check Vercel status page
- Post to Vercel community/support
- Consider temporary static hosting backup

### 4. SECURITY INCIDENT

**Types:**
- Compromised API keys
- Malicious code injection
- Unauthorized access
- DDoS attacks

**Immediate Response:**

```bash
# Step 1: Take site offline (if severe)
# Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Functions → Disable

# Step 2: Rotate all credentials
# GitHub: Regenerate VERCEL_TOKEN
# OpenWeatherMap: Generate new API key
# Vercel: Update environment variables
```

**Security Incident Checklist:**
- [ ] Identify attack vector
- [ ] Preserve logs and evidence
- [ ] Rotate all API keys and tokens
- [ ] Update environment variables
- [ ] Scan codebase for malicious changes
- [ ] Deploy clean version
- [ ] Monitor for continued attacks
- [ ] Document incident for future reference

### 5. DATABASE/STATE CORRUPTION

**Note:** This application is stateless - no database to corrupt
- All data cached temporarily in browser
- External APIs are source of truth
- LocalStorage only for user preferences

**If Browser Storage Issues:**
- Clear browser cache resolves issues
- No server-side data recovery needed

---

## AUTOMATED MONITORING & ALERTING

### Health Check Monitoring

**Built-in Monitoring:**
```typescript
// Health checks run every 30 minutes
import { healthService } from './src/services/productionHealthService';

healthService.startHealthMonitoring(30);
```

**External Monitoring Setup:**

**UptimeRobot (Recommended Free):**
```bash
# Setup monitors for:
# 1. Main site: https://bermuda-rocket-tracker.vercel.app
# 2. API health: Custom health endpoint
# 3. Critical user flows

# Alert channels:
# - Email notifications
# - SMS for critical alerts
# - Slack integration (optional)
```
