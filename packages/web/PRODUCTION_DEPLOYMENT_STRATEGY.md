## 3. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION

### Required GitHub Secrets:
```bash
VERCEL_TOKEN=<your-vercel-token>
VERCEL_ORG_ID=<your-org-id>
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=<openweather-api-key>
```

### Vercel Environment Variables:
```bash
# Production
REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=<production-key>
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
REACT_APP_ENV=production
REACT_APP_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true

# Preview (Staging)
REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=<staging-key>
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
REACT_APP_ENV=staging
```

### Environment-Specific Settings:
- **Development**: Debug mode, extended timeouts, detailed logging
- **Staging**: Production-like with testing features enabled
- **Production**: Optimized performance, minimal logging, security hardened

---

## 4. SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION

### Security Headers (via vercel.json):
```json
{
  "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://ll.thespacedevs.com https://api.openweathermap.org",
  "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
  "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
  "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
  "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
  "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
  "Permissions-Policy": "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=(), payment=(), usb=()"
}
```

### Security Measures:
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Automatic via Vercel
- **API Key Protection**: Environment variables only, never in code
- **CSP Headers**: Restrict content sources to prevent XSS
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Bundle Analysis**: Monitor for malicious code injection

---

## 5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Current Performance Metrics:
- **Bundle Size**: 96.56KB gzipped ✅
- **First Contentful Paint**: <1.5s target
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: <2.5s target
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: <0.1 target

### Optimization Features:
- **Static Asset Caching**: 1 year cache for immutable assets
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic via Create React App
- **Tree Shaking**: Dead code elimination enabled
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic via Vercel
- **CDN Distribution**: Global edge caching

### Performance Monitoring:
```typescript
// Production health monitoring service included
import { healthService } from './services/productionHealthService';

// Automatic health checks every 30 minutes
healthService.startHealthMonitoring(30);
```

---

## 6. MONITORING & ALERTING

### Built-in Monitoring:
- **Vercel Analytics**: Real-time Web Vitals tracking
- **Production Health Service**: Custom health checks for external APIs
- **Build Monitoring**: CI/CD pipeline status and performance
- **Error Tracking**: Console logging with production filtering

### Health Check Endpoints:
```typescript
// Health check covers:
- Launch Library API availability
- OpenWeather API connectivity  
- Local storage functionality
- DOM accessibility
- Memory usage tracking
```

### Performance Baseline:
- **Bundle Size**: Track changes over time
- **Load Time**: Monitor deployment-to-deployment
- **API Response Times**: External service monitoring
- **Memory Usage**: Client-side resource consumption

---

## 7. DISASTER RECOVERY & ROLLBACK

### Immediate Rollback Procedures:

**Vercel Dashboard Rollback:**
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard] → Project → Deployments
2. Find last known-good deployment
3. Click "Promote to Production"
4. Verify deployment health

**Git-based Rollback:**
```bash
# Emergency code rollback
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or roll back to specific commit
git reset --hard <good-commit-hash>
git push --force origin main
```

### Recovery Time Objectives:
- **Detection**: <5 minutes (automated health checks)
- **Response**: <2 minutes (immediate rollback capability)
- **Recovery**: <10 minutes (full service restoration)

### Backup Strategies:
- **Code**: Git repository (distributed backup)
- **Configuration**: Version controlled environment files
- **Deployments**: Vercel maintains deployment history
- **Data**: No persistent data (stateless application)
